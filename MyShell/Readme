To do:
9 / 11 / 12 / 13
Makefile
run some tests to make sure everything is working

Notes:

Implementation of 1A (redirection of stderr '2>'):
1) Creation of file with the specified name
2) Close stderr
3) use dup on fd to give specified file the fd of stderr
(will be stderr for sure because its the lowest one possible)
4) Close fd

Implementation of 1B (redirection to the end of the file '>>'):
Same as above except close stdout and open the new file with append flag.

Implementation of 2 (change prompt):
declare prompt of len of argv[1] + 2, copy argv[1] into
prompt var and append ": " to it.

Implementation of 3 (echo):
Loop over argv and print each arg, if it starts with '$' look it
up in the var array and print the var if exists.

Implementation of 4 (echo $?):
printf(status)
